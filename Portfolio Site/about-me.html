    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p class="generalInfo">My name is Petar Velinov. I'm 26 year old from Sofia, Bulgaria. I graduated from Professional School of Audio, Video and Telecommunication and my studies focused on Low Frequency Techniques. Then I graduated from Sofia University. My specialty was Bulgarian Philology. Later I took Telerik Academy's courses and began developing my own skills in the area of software and web development which brings my love for technology and languages together. Currently I'm working as a JavaScript developer.</p>

        <h2>How did it start?</h2>
        <p>
            I bought my first PC during my bachelor's degree. In 2008 I made my first website. Playing with HTML and CSS was my hobby. Later I realized that I wanted to achieve more professionally and decided to turn my hobby into a real job. Then I started learning more about making websites at home. One day, while browsing for some JavaScript materials, I found Telerik Academy's courses. I thought this was a good way of becoming a professional so I applied. 
I was proud with the first website I made several years ago. Today I look at my first works and laugh at my messy code, realizing how much I've grown and how much more I need to learn.
