                <h3>Average Calculator</h3>
                <p id="calculatorDescription">In the spring of 2013 I wanted to create a GUI program, so here is my first one. This calculator can help school teachers to calculate student's GPA (grade point average). I know several teachers whom I thought might find this useful. Current version is in bulgarian only and requires .NET Framework 4.0. Click on the image to see the code at GitHub or <a href="projects/dotNET/Average-Calculator/Average-Calculator.exe">download</a> (19.5KB) the standalone EXE to try it.</p>

        <p class="generalInfo">One of the greatest times at Telerik Academy is the team work. You meet new people who are full of ideas and try to collaborate, climbing the ladder step by step.</p>

                <h3>The Sokoban project</h3>
                <p>When I was first involved in a team project our task was to create a console application. At our first meeting we shared ideas, thought about what we could do and how we could do it. Eventually, we decided to make the Sokoban game. We were not equally experienced or knowledgeable, but everyone was participating with all they could. You can take a look at this project at CodePlex by clicking on the image.</p>

                <h3>The King Survival project</h3>
                <p>This time our task was to refactor a given C# code. This was a game called "King survival". We created a repository at GitHub, but it's no longer available. You can download a zip of this project by following the image link. It is located on this server. There are both the original code and the refactored code inside.</p>
