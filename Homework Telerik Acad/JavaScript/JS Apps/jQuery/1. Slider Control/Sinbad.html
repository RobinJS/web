    <img src="images/sinbadheader.jpg" />
    <p>One of fantasy's most legendary characters, Sinbad, comes to life in this exciting new series.</p>
    <p>After Sinbad accidentally kills the son of powerful Lord Akbari, he is forced to flee -- under a curse -- from his home town of Basra. Now unable to be on dry land for more than a day (thanks to the curse), Sinbad must travel the world to find a cure and return home. On board his new home - the ship, The Providence - an intriguing band of travelers is thrown together, including taciturn Norwegian sailor Gunnar, the lithe and agile jewel-thief Rina, and haughty and aristocratic Nala. Completing the ship's complement is the odd-ball cook and the cerebral doctor Anwar.</p>
    <p>Little does Sinbad know that as he sails the high seas, he's being hunted by Lord Akbari, determined to exact revenge for his son's death.</p>
